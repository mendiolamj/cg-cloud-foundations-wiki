Some notes:

- when creating the ec2 instance, remember to add your name to make it unique
- please be sure to create all resources in the us-west-2 region (even if instructions say otherwise)
- when using your own VPC for EC2, be sure to use the public subnet (not private!)
- For the security group name and description, you can just put in "your initials - web server"
- be sure to select auto-assign public IP
- when creating the IAM Role - add your initials to `SSMInstanceProfile`
