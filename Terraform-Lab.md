Here's an overview of the lab:

Here are the steps to take:

1. Navigate to IAM Users > CloudLearner. 
1. Navigate to the Security Credentials tab and click on the Create access key button (if you donâ€™t have it already with you). 
1. Download and save the generated file on your laptop. This file contains secret access keys for your CloudLearner user. 
1. Make sure you have removed the IAM role from your Public EC2 instance. 
1. On the Public EC2 instance, configure your credentials for AWS CLI. Execute: 


```console
aws configure 
Specify the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key from the file you have. 
Specify us-east-1 for region.
Specify json for output format. 
```
6. Do the necessary setup on the Public EC2 instance to run Terraform code. Execute the following: 

```console
aws sts get-caller-identity

sudo yum install -y yum-utils

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo

sudo yum -y install terraform

terraform -help

terraform -install-autocomplete

source ~/.bashrc

mkdir tf-lab

cd tf-lab

wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/main.tf 

ls 

terraform init

terraform validate

terraform apply
```

7. Verify the created resource in the AWS management console. 
8. Now destroy this resource. Execute:

```console
terraform destroy
rm main.tf
```

---------------------------------------------

## Variables Testing

Delete the older main.tf file. 

Download these files: 


```console
wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/02+-+with+input+%26+output+file/variables.tf

wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/02+-+with+input+%26+output+file/main.tf

wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/02+-+with+input+%26+output+file/outputs.tf

wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/03+-+with+tfvars/testing.tfvars 
```

Execute: 
```console
terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bonus Milestone
Delete all the files from the tf-lab folder and then download this file. 

```console
wget https://usaa-aws-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-lab/vpc/main.tf 
```

Execute this once and create the VPC. Then, destroy it. 

Afterwards, create a variables.tf file and a test.tfvars file. 

You should specify the VPC CIDR and all the subnet CIDRs using these variable files. At last, execute it by passing the CIDR values from the test.tfvars file. 

Execute terraform destroy and delete the resources.
