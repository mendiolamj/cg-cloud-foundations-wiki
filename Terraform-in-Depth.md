We will be going through a lot of exercises here to get more familiar with Terraform:

https://github.com/varoonsahgal/tf-fundamentals.git

In your VM's:

- be sure that you have configured the aws cli via `aws configure`
- clone down the terraform repository that has the exercises onto your virtual machine - via `git clone https://github.com/varoonsahgal/tf-fundamentals`
- Once you clone the repository, you can then go into the exercises directory and work from there
- for each exercise, cd into the exercise directory and apply all terraform commands from within the respective exercise directory itself
- Also, note that in exercise 3 you will get an S3 bucket not found error - you can just create a bucket yourself in S3 to create objects within
- And, in front of the bucket name you can remove the `devint-` prefix
