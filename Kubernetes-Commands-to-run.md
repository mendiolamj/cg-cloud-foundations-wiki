List of commands we will be using for the class - 

### Open a terminal on your VM and run the following commands:

> To know the version of kubectl use syntax - `kubectl version --client`

> To know the version of Minikube use syntax - `minikube version` 

### Once kubectl & minikube are installed & verified, you can now easily play around. 

> Just enter `minikube` in your terminal and you'll see a list of commands and options available to you.

### Start your Cluster

> Simply start a new cluster by using the syntax - `minikube start` command. 

_Hold on for some time and let minikube do its job._ 

### Understanding kubectl

Once your minikube cluster is up, you can start interacting with it using kubectl. One simple way of using kubectl is to get used to the command format. We've simplified this for you - 

`**kubectl <what action do you want to do> <on which resource> -n <your namespace> <other options> <name of the resource>**`
