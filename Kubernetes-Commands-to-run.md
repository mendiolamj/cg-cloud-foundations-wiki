List of commands we will be using for the class - 

### Open a terminal on your VM and run the following commands:

> To know the version of kubectl use syntax - `kubectl version --client`

> To know the version of Minikube use syntax - `minikube version` 

### Once kubectl & minikube are installed & verified, you can now easily play around. 

> Just enter `minikube` in your terminal and you'll see a list of commands and options available to you.

### Start your Cluster

> Simply start a new cluster by using the syntax - `minikube start` command. 
_Hold on for some time and let minikube do its job._
