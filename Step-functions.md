Execute the lab here:

Note that for step  4c, the list of ARN’s might not appear - you can easily navigate to the respective lambda’s that need to be invoked and copy over the ARN that you see on the bottom right:

Also note that when you execute the step function it may not “succeed” the first time - that is expected behavior as it’s mentioned in the lab itself as well.
