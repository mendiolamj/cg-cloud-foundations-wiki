# Creating a Kubernetes Deployment 

* We will create a Deployment that will roll out a ReplicaSet to bring up three instances of an nginx Pod. You must have a running Kubernetes cluster with the kubectl command-line tool configured and connected.
* Creating a Deployment is the same as creating a ReplicaSet, but Deployment is the kind propertyâ€™s value. Moreso, strategy property and values need to be added to the manifest file.
* Create a YAML manifest file named my-deployment.yaml using vi on the command line. Use syntax `vi my-deployment.yaml`
* Copy, paste, and save the configuration below into your YAML file. **The indentation is very Important!**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 
kind: Deployment 
metadata: 
  name: my-deployment 
spec: 
  replicas: 3 
  strategy: 
    type: Recreate 
  selector: 
    matchLabels: 
      app: my-app 
  template: 
    metadata: 
      labels: 
        app: my-app 
    spec: 
      containers: 
      - name: my-deployment-container 
        image: nginx
```
* The above configuration file defined a Deployment object named my-deployment under the metadata.name property with Deployment as the value of its kind property. 
```
spec.replicas: ## the Deployment will create the number of replicated Pods specified in this field
spec.strategy.type: ## the desired strategy type is declared in this field
The strategy is a child of the spec while type is a child of the strategy and grandchild of spec
spec.selector: ## this field defines how the Deployment determines which Pods to manage
spec.containers: ## the container name and image are declared in this field
```
* Run this command to create a Deployment - `kubectl create -f my-deployment.yaml`
* Check the Deployment status to see if it has been created `kubectl get deployments my-deployment`
* When you see an output like this, it means the Deployment is still being created. 
* Wait for a few seconds and run the kubectl get command once again - `kubectl get deployment my-deployment`. 
* The status output is further broken down below:

```
Name: ## Shows the name of the Deployment as declared in the manifest file
Ready: ## This shows the number of replicas that are ready for use. In this case, all 3 out of 3 are ready for use
Up-To-Date: ## This shows the up-to-date number of replicas out of the desired number declared in the YAML file
Available: ## This shows the number of replicas that are available for use 
Age: ## Shows the duration the application has been running
```

* Check the Pod status to confirm if the desired number of Pods are running - `kubectl get pods` 
* To delete one of the instances of the Pod - `kubectl delete pod/podname`
* Check if it has been deleted `kubectl get pods`
* As you would see, three instances of Pod are running while the old ones have already been terminated or deleted. 
* This was made possible with the help of ReplicaSet. 
* One of the importance of ReplicaSet in a Deployment is to ensure that the desire instances of a Pod are up-to-date and are continually running on the cluster. 
* The number of running instances depends on the ReplicaSet value declared in the YAML manifest file.
* To view the description of the Deployment - `kubectl describe deployments my-deployment`
* The Deployment description is further expantiated below:
```
Name: ## The name of the Deployment as specified in the manifest file.
Namespace: ## It is always a default if no namespace is specified in the manifest file.
Replicaset: ## The desired number of replicas specified in the manifest file.
Strategy.recreate: ## The strategy to be used for the Deployment. You can find more info on Deployment strategy in the next part of this series.
Containers.image: ## This field specifies the container and container image names.
Events: ## Shows the Deployment activities since it was created.
```
